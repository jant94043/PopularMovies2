# Popular Movies 2

This is an Android app listing currently popular and highly rated movies.
It displays movie posters, brief movie descriptions, reviews and can launch movie trailers. The movie info is retrievied from the [themoviedb.org].
The app supports both Android phone and tablet devices.

I created this app as a project for my [Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree]

To build and use this app, a [TMDb API key] must be obtained and inserted into file "TheMovieDbApiKey.java".
